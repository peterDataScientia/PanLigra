# PanLigra Publication Renderer Contract

The current molecule, residue, interaction, distance-label and legend appearance is a protected PanLigra asset.

## Protected visual behavior

The following must remain visually unchanged unless a deliberate publication-design revision is approved:

- ligand/molecule bond depiction and stroke hierarchy;
- heteroatom typography and element colors;
- residue label typography, white knockout and placement;
- residue leader behavior;
- non-covalent interaction routing, endpoint offsets, colors, dash pattern and width;
- interaction-distance placement and magenta typography;
- legend ordering, sample style, typography, spacing and placement;
- canvas fitting, whitespace balance and publication margins.

Refactoring, renaming, moving code between modules, improving scientific-data handling, adding tests, fixing PDBQT processing, improving exports and changing non-visual architecture are allowed **only if the approved rendered appearance remains equivalent**.

## Baselines

The original five-class publication baseline is Git commit:

`237db30af8639379ed3976657f9bbcce28110725`

Safety branch:

`publication-renderer-baseline-2026-10-01`

The approved PanLigra 6 eight-class renderer baseline is:

`3c6a3390f65c5f30ccb367b52cf916cd5683d0e6`

Safety branch:

`publication-renderer-eight-class-baseline-2026-10-01`

The legacy baseline remains the reference for proving that HPI/HB/SB/PS/PC molecule/residue geometry was not redesigned. The eight-class baseline is the active reference for future releases.

At the renderer baseline:

- `utils.py::_draw_mol` defines the static publication renderer.
- `interactive_engine.py::_exact_panligra_layout` reproduces its established residue, interaction and distance geometry for the editor.

## Regression strategy

Automated tests use two complementary safeguards:

1. **Golden geometry** — a representative synthetic scene is run through the layout engine and residue positions, interaction endpoints, distance labels and font sizes are compared to an approved snapshot.
2. **Visual style contract** — publication stroke widths, interaction offsets, collision-search geometry, font scaling, colors and distance-label styling are checked explicitly.

These checks protect output behavior rather than the names of implementation functions. If the code is reorganized or renamed, the tests may be adapted to the new API, but the approved visual output must continue to satisfy the same contract.

## Development principle

> Improve PanLigra around the renderer; do not casually redesign the renderer.

A visual change should be treated as a scientific/publication design decision, not as a side effect of code cleanup.


## PanLigra 6 approved interaction-layer extension

PanLigra 6 deliberately extends the interaction vocabulary from five to all eight PLIP classes while preserving the pre-existing molecule and residue design.

The following legacy visual rules remain unchanged for HPI, HB, SB, PS and PC:
- ligand depiction and covalent bond styling;
- residue placement and typography;
- distance-label placement algorithm;
- canvas fitting and whitespace;
- existing interaction colors, widths and offsets.

The following new interaction-only semantics are approved:
- **WB — Water bridge:** cyan/teal, short-dashed;
- **XB — Halogen bond:** violet, dashed;
- **MC — Metal coordination:** brown, compact-dashed.

This extension is additive. It does not authorize unrelated changes to ligand structure rendering, residue layout, or the established five interaction styles.


## Approved publication legend revision

The publication legend is standardized as follows:

- Canonical interaction order: HPI → HB → WB → SB → PS → PC → XB → MC.
- Publication labels: Hydrophobic contact, Hydrogen bond, Water bridge, Salt bridge, π-Stacking, π-Cation, Halogen bond, Metal coordination.
- Only interaction types present in the figure are shown.
- The legend automatically wraps into centered multiple rows when a single row would exceed the publication canvas.
- Maximum default legend width is constrained to the smaller of 900 px or the canvas width minus 80 px.
- Existing interaction-line colors, widths, and dash semantics remain unchanged.
- Manually added interaction types are inserted into the canonical scientific order unless the user explicitly reorders legend items.
